	<h2>by Joseph Wang</h2>
	<div>
		<ul>
		<li>There could be more variety of layouts that you can try.</li>
		<li>The image in the layouts flipped position when you transfer from web to mobile. It may be easier to keep them in a relattively same position to construct.</li>
		<li>The typeface has really thin strokes that may disappear into the background.</li>
		<li>I wonder if there is a way to make the quote and the person in the picture more intergrated.</li>
		<li>you missed a "'" in the third quote for the web version. It should be "it's"</li>
		<li>you can explore more color options</li>
